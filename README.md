UnicodeViewer
============

U+View is a comprehensive, graphical Unicode reference App. It features Unicode block view, personal favorites and a fast full text search. The Unicode reference App was created as a simple tool for your daily tasks as programmer or web developer. But it also comes handy in cooperation with twitter, instant messaging etc.

Consider you are writing a short message to a friend and want to include a smiley &#x1f603; or append an birthday cake &#x1f382;. All these and many more emoticons (emojis) can easily be searched by name, copied into clipboard, saved as favorite and used in your App of course.

As a programmer you often need to encode Unicode code points in different ways. This App makes this task very easy. Simply look up the character you need, switch to its details view and copy the corresponding UTF-8, Unicode or HTML entity encoding. You can also find debug information e.g. the mojibake encoding you see if the given code point is wrong encoded.

To look up a character or code point you can ether browse by Unicode block or use the integrated full text search. Browsing blocks is especially use full if you already know the category of character you are looking for, e.g. mathematical symbols. Even if you found a character by full text search you can easily navigate to the including code block.

Full text search is a power full feature to look up code points. You can copy a single character into the search field and get detailed information in a second. But the full utillity is reveled if you search by name or hex encoding. The full text search index stores the name and encoding of every Unicode code point. So searching for "subscript" yields all subscript character, e. g. you can now type COâ‚‚ the right way.

Not every Unicode code point can be displayed. Some need special fonts or simply don't have a graphical representation. To let you research more information about these characters links to Wikipedia and FileFormat.Info are included in the details view of every character.
